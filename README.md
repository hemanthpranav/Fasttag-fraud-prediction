Fastag is an electronic toll system for highways which makes travel smooth and unchoked. However, fraudulent activities within Fastag system bring a lot of problems in terms of money losses and security breach.

The subsequent FastTag Fraud detection, uses several ML Algorithms, that assists with prediction of fradulent Transactions. For instance if a heavy truck is charging as if they are a car then the system should flag as fraud. This is a Classification Problem

Overview

This project is concerned with the application of machine learning classification strategies to enable a dependable transaction fraud predictor suited for FASTag transactions. Through studies of vital data characteristics such as transaction records, vehicle details, geographical locations, and values of transaction, the system hopes to pinpoint fraudulent activities accurately. The end objective is to secure and make sure that transactions using FASTags are secure and reliable from potential fraud risks involved.

Project Objectives:

Exploratory Data Analysis: The data shows that Lane B102 reports the highest number of fraudulent transaction. This finding is an indication that proper emphasis should be given to a series of improved security measures and monitoring systems in this lane to avoid the risk of fraud.

Peak times of the fraudulent activity identified in the analysis are between 4PM, 10PM and 6AM which have the highest incidences of fraud. These insights reflect critical time windows which should be monitored and preventive measures should be increased in order to effectively fight against fraud.

The analysis reveals massive vehicles with the peak being SUVs and Vans as the most common violators involved in fraudulent activities. Moreover Sedans and Trucks show apparent levels of involvement calling for targeted surveillance and preventive actions for such vehicles.

Results The Logistic Regression had the best performance given:

Accuracy - 0.782

Precision -0.782783

Recall - 0.998723

F1 - 0.877666
